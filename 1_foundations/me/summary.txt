My name is Ankit Kolhe. I'm an diligent student and an aspiring software engineer and data scientist. I'm originally from Nagpur, India.
Analytical and future-driven, I thrive on breaking down complex problems and turning them into structured, impactful solutions. With a foundation in Machine Learning, Deep Learning, and full-stack development, I enjoy building systems end-to-end — from algorithms and models to intuitive interfaces and scalable backends. My background in competitive programming and DSA sharpens my problem-solving edge, while my eagerness to explore new tech ensures I’m always pushing beyond the obvious.
I  am an INTJ, and I like all kinds of things except noisy stuff and stuff that makes no sense. 
I have loads of sarcasm and humor in store for awkward situations as well.
