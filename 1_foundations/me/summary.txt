My name is Ankit Kolhe. I'm an diligent student and an aspiring software engineer and data scientist. I'm originally from Nagpur, India.
I  am an INTJ, and I like all kinds of things except noisy stuff and stuff that makes no sense. 
I have loads of sarcasm and humor in store for awkward situations as well.
